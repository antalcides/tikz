Plotting with Gnuplot and/or TikZ
=================================

In the following, I describe and compare various ways for including
plots in a LaTeX document, focusing on approaches that incorporate
Gnuplot_, TikZ_, or both.

In the past, I have plotted data using Gnuplot_ using the postscript
terminal, usually directly from Python_ (where I created the data)
with `Gnuplot.py`_.  After discovering TikZ_, I am now interested in
using TikZ for plots, too; in particular, this helps to ensure that
all fonts within the document look the same, and that proper line
widths are used etc.  (For details, see chapter 4 on "Guidelines on
Graphics" and section 16.1 "When Should One Use TikZ for Generating
Plots?" in the fine `PGF manual`_.)

Along the way, I hope to fix problems with line spacing in legends,
too: A common approach to prevent the font size from becoming
unreadable in plots that are scaled using
e.g. ``\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{...}`` in LaTeX is to
``set size 0.8`` in Gnuplot.  However, this leads to very close (in
the extreme, overlapping) lines in the legend, which has to be fixed
manually e.g. using ``set key bottom right spacing 2``.

Gnuplot, Postscript Terminal
----------------------------

This is very easy to set up; from Python, I am using something like
this to produce and plot the data, including labels etc.:

.. code-block:: python

  def edgePlotData(edge, title):
      return Gnuplot.Data([(al, gm.siv[p])
                           for al, p in arcLengthIter(edge, wsStats)],
                          title = title, with = "lp ps 0.7")

  g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
  g('set terminal postscript eps color solid')
  g('set output "valueplot-flowlines.eps"')
  g('set xlabel "arc length distance $t$ from saddle [pixels]"')
  g('set ylabel "boundary indicator value $|\vec{b}_g(t)|$"')
  g('set arrow from 0,0 to 0,15 nohead lt 0')
  g('set label " saddle pos" at 0,14 left')
  g.set_range("xrange", (-5, 5))

  g('set size 0.8') # larger fonts, please
  g.plot(myPlotData(noiseEdge, "undesired, noise-induced edge"),
         myPlotData(goodEdge, "real, high-contrast image edge"),
         myPlotData(weakEdge, "real, low-contrast image edge"),
         myPlotData(streamerEdge, "streamer (converging tangentially to real edges)"))

The result looks like this:

.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_eps.png

Here are the data files and commands to recreate this "at home":

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines.gnuplot,tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_[1234].dat

.. CAUTION::

  One disadvantage of `Gnuplot.py`_ is that if you automate your plots
  like this, you might find yourself needing a ``time.sleep(1)`` in
  order to prevent the temporary data files being deleted before the
  separate ``gnuplot``-process has read them.  I guess one should use
  something like matplotlib_ nowadays, but I got so used to Gnuplot_..

AFAIK, this process is standard and has been used like this for years.
As Alain Matthes pointed out, you might run into encoding problems
nowadays, in the transition phase to UTF-8, which is becoming the new
standard for many software packages and platforms.

Another problem arises if one tries to change the font; although
Gnuplot allows to change every small detail, I think one usually
leaves such things as the font alone, but this results in different
fonts in the EPS-embedded plots than in the rest of your LaTeX
document.

Also, when using ``epstopdf`` to convert the figures for use with
pdflatex (and KOMA-Script), their text became garbled, obviously
because of a font problem.  I had to use ``epstoeps`` *and*
``epstopdf`` one after another to fix this.

TODO: Alain mentioned gnuplottex_:

  This package is very useful; you can, like with tikz, execute some
  commands with gnuplot and insert the result directly in your
  document.  I use only this method to draw some surfaces z=f(x,y).

Gnuplot, XFig Terminal
----------------------

The ``fig``-terminal has the advantage of being able to produce
"special" text, i.e. text that can be converted into LaTeX commands to
get the same font as in the rest of the document and support formulas
etc.  In the above code, just change the terminal line and output
filename (I have also removed the ``set size``, since the LaTeX font
size is large enough, and added some formulas to showcase the LaTeX
features):

.. code-block:: python

  #g('set terminal postscript eps color')
  g('set terminal fig metric color textspecial')
  g('set output "valueplot-flowlines.fig"')
  ...
  g('set xlabel "arc length distance $t$ from saddle [pixels]"')
  g(r'set ylabel "boundary indicator value $|\\vec{b}_g(t)|$"')

Unfortunately, Gnuplot_ annoyed me here, again (*update:* this was
version 4.0.0 - the current 4.2.2 release does not have this problem):
the colors in the resulting document were completely different than in
the postscript.  (AFAICS, this is not considered as bug, but each
terminal may freely choose the plot style appearance.)  In particular,
the first plot uses black instead of red color, and the "saddle pos"
mark in the center is not dotted anymore:

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_fig.gnuplot,tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines.fig
.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_fig.png

Thus, I have hacked a small python module `gnuplotfig.py`_, based on
my `fig.py`_ module, which tries to parse and improve gnuplot's XFig
output:

* move separate plots and axis ticks on separate layers (the default
  puts nearly everything on depth 10)
* heuristically fix colors (in this example you see that the
  "saddle pos" mark cannot be distinguished from the plot and is also
  "fixed" to red)
* try to extract value range and store that as XFig comments in the
  file (`gnuplotfig.py`_ offers coordinate conversions based on this)

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_fixed.fig
.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_fixed_fig.png

The main benefit from adding the extra indirection via XFig_ is that
XFig supports "special" text, i.e. a flag that marks text as
to-be-interpreted by LaTeX.  Then, you can use fig2dev with a special
target language to produce a PS/PDF with the background and a separate
chunk of TeX code that overlays the text using LaTeX.  (Details on
this process can be found on the "`LaTeX and XFig
<http://www.xfig.org/userman/latex_and_xfig.html>`_" page available on
the XFig homepage.)  This is made especially convenient in LyX_, which
allows you to directly insert the XFig file as "external material" and
does all the necessary intermediate steps for you.

.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_fixed_fig_latex.png

The above figure is the result of a LaTeX run using
``\input{valueplot-flowlines_fixed.pdftex}`` to include the
automatically generated TeX code.  The process was facilitated with
the following Makefile rules::

  %-pdftex.pdf: %.fig
    fig2dev -L pdftex $< $@

  %.pdftex: %.fig %-pdftex.pdf
    fig2dev -L pdftex_t -p $*-pdftex.pdf $< $@

  %.pdf: %.tex
    pdflatex $<

  valueplot-flowlines_fixed_fig_latex.pdf: valueplot-flowlines_fixed.pdftex

Unfortunately, the generated code is cluttered with font-setting commands::

  \begin{picture}(4113,2862)(937,-3710)
  \put(1363,-3363){\makebox(0,0)[rb]{\smash{{\SetFigFont{10}{12.0}{\familydefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault} 0}}}}
  \put(1363,-2887){\makebox(0,0)[rb]{\smash{{\SetFigFont{10}{12.0}{\familydefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault} 5}}}}
  \put(1363,-2411){\makebox(0,0)[rb]{\smash{{\SetFigFont{10}{12.0}{\familydefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault} 10}}}}
  ...
  \put(1048,-2114){\rotatebox{90.0}{\makebox(0,0)[b]{\smash{{\SetFigFont{10}{12.0}{\familydefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault}boundary indicator value $|\vec{b}_g(t)|$}}}}}
  ...
  \put(4455,-1465){\makebox(0,0)[rb]{\smash{{\SetFigFont{10}{12.0}{\familydefault}{\mddefault}{\updefault}streamer (converging to real edges)}}}}
  \end{picture}%

Even though the font size can be configured within Gnuplot, it would
still be better to use LaTeX's default font sizes, or at least
commands like `\small` or the like.  Also, the line spacing e.g. in
the legend is unsatisfactory, and this gets much worse if one uses the
above ``set size ...`` option of Gnuplot.  Resizing using a
``\resizebox`` in LaTeX is undesirable since it again affects line
widths and font sizes.

On the plus side, we at least have LaTeX fonts and formulas.  The
effort for creating such plots is larger than with Gnuplot alone, but
it can be automated to a fair degree (and is trivial to achieve within
LyX).

Gnuplot, XFig Terminal + fig2tikz
---------------------------------

The XFig files generated above can be converted to TikZ code using my
fig2tikz_ script:

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_fixed_fig.tikz
.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_fixed_fig_tikz.png

This already brings many of TikZ_'s advantages, e.g. you may scale the
plot without changing the linewidths etc.  Furthermore, the generated
code is much cleaner than the above, since fig2tikz_ has a
``--nofonts`` switch that disables the output of font-setting
commands::

  \path (3.02667,9.33778) node[anchor=base east] { 0};
  \path (3.02667,8.28) node[anchor=base east] { 5};
  \path (3.02667,7.22222) node[anchor=base east] { 10};
  ...
  \path (2.32667,6.56222) node[anchor=base,rotate=90.0] {boundary indicator value $|\vec{b}_g(t)|$};
  ...
  \path (9.89778,5.12) node[anchor=base east] {streamer (converging to real edges)};

However, the code is far from what I would have written by hand.
Especially, all coordinate transformations have been performed by
Gnuplot_, which is sad since TikZ_ gives all the necessary features to
position the original data points on the plot.  (E.g. you could be
able to change the plot range etc. in the resulting code, but not
using this method.)  Also, the interline spacing is still bad.

Gnuplot + TikZ Terminal
-----------------------

Peter Hedwig has written a `lua terminal`_ for Gnuplot that comes with
a TikZ backend (and only with this) written in lua.  See also the
`example on Kjell's useful site
<http://www.fauskes.net/pgftikzexamples/gnuplot-tikz-terminal/>`_.

Unfortunately, this requires a recompilation of Gnuplot (if you don't
download one of the provided binaries, which might on the other hand
be missing other features).  Even then, the resulting TeX code seems
to rely on newer LaTeX packages than I have (still using TeTeX), and
did not compile.

Also, this still does not use TikZ's ``plot`` command, but simply
draws all coordinates using a normal ``\path`` with the *transformed*
coordinates (see above), which is unsatisfactory.  In the best case,
the output is expected to be similar to the above, fig2tikz-generated
code.

TikZ 'plot' command
-------------------

As mentioned above, TikZ_ itself provides a ``plot`` command that can
be used within paths to plot data that is provided inline, via
external files, or as a mathematical function.  (See section 16 in the
`PGF manual`_.)  One big advantage of this approach is that one can
use TikZ's coordinate transformations for mapping the raw data into
the figure, which makes it possible to change the plot scale / domain
etc. at any time, and allows one to add additional graphical elements
(e.g. arrows, text nodes, ...) at the correct positions using the
convenient TikZ API.  Furthermore, the above-mentioned advantages of
using TikZ for the correct line widths and text sizes of course apply
to this method, too.

The main disadvantage is the same: you *have* to use TikZ's coordinate
transformations in order to map the data into the desired figure
range.  Also, there are no axes and ticks drawn automatically, so you
have to do everything yourself.

Another major problem is that if your data to be plotted contains too
large or too small numbers, you easily exceed the valid range for TeX
dimensions (even if only for intermediate states before the
transformations are applied).  This is stated in the PGF manual and is
a known limitation which the user is expected to work around himself,
e.g. by scaling the data to be plotted before feeding it to LaTeX.

For example, the data to be plotted can be written to simple ASCII
files (suitable for Gnuplot, too) and plotted using the following
code:

.. code-block:: latex
   :source-file: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_plots.tikz

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_plots.tikz

.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_plots_tikz.png

pgfplots
--------

The pgfplots_ package by Christian Feuersänger is available via CTAN.
It is based on PGF/TikZ and provides some very useful features for
plotting:

* The plot area size can be specified and defaults to a sane default;
  the range of the data to be plotted is auto-detected and the scaling
  is set up appropriately.  It also supports setting the x/yrange to
  be plotted, and the plot will be *scaled and clipped* accordingly.
* AFAICS, pgfplots_ contains special code for *handling numbers beyond
  what TeX/PGF support* natively.
* Furthermore, it is possible to have *logarithmic scaling* along one or
  both axis.
* Similar to Gnuplot, you can specify multiple data to be plotted, and
  pgfplots will choose from a *set of predefined styles* in order to
  discriminate different plots within the same axis.  Even better - it
  also supports a *convenient automatic legend* of these styles/plots.

Thus, it fills in many of the gaps left by PGF/TikZ alone, and allows
to benefit from all of TikZ's beauty... nearly.  I have found many
small limitations that stem from the fact that it is not well
integrated into TikZ, e.g. I would have expected to be able to easily
reference all parts of the plot by using named nodes and anchors,
which is not currently possible (the nodes are part of scopes, which
prevent access to their content).  Christian Feuersänger is working
actively on improving this, and he has patiently listened to my
requests/comments, but the currently released version is quite limited
in this respect.

Similarly, one may specify the TikZ styles for many relevant parts of
pgfplots' output, but one has to modify e.g. ``every axis legend`` and
cannot easily add style options for just a single object.

Another important limitation is that with the release I tested
(0.92.3, the current at time of writing), only inline data can be
plotted.  Christian Feuersänger has since implemented plotting data
from files AFAIK, but you cannot simply use all of TikZ's plot sources
(e.g. Gnuplot function specifications).

Here is the running example, styled beautifully with pgfplots and
TikZ:

.. code-block:: latex
   :source-file: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_pgfplots.tikz

.. download:: tikz/plots/valueplot-flowlines_pgfplots.tikz

.. image:: valueplot-flowlines_pgfplots_tikz.png

Some other small things to be improved were the automatic tick marks,
which are not as good as in Gnuplot (heh - that's OK, I find it
impressive that it *has* automatic tick marks at all, but one should
be aware of this respect), and if you specify the xrange, the yrange
is not computed from just the respective part of the data, but still
from the whole set, i.e. you often find yourself having to specify
both, when you would just specify one in Gnuplot.

tkz-fct
-------

Alain Matthes' `TKZ stuff on AlterMundus
<http://www.altermundus.fr/pages/download.html>`_ contains a
tkz-fct_ package.  Again, check the `example on Kjell's site
<http://www.fauskes.net/pgftikzexamples/tkz-plot2d/>`_.  I have not
yet checked this out due to time constraints, but I hope I will
eventually be able to do so.

pgfgraph
--------

Similar to tkz-fct_, I have not yet had a closer look at the pgfgraph_
package by Pascal Wolkotte, which is another promising extension for
plotting with PGF/TikZ.
